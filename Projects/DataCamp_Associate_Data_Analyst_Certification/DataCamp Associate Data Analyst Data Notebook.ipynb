What I done first was to create a table schema on my local SQL Server using the following DDL:\n\n`CREATE TABLE 'test'.'pet_store' (\n  'product_id' INT NULL,\n  'product_category' VARCHAR(45) NULL,\n  'sales' VARCHAR(45) NULL,\n  'price' FLOAT NULL,\n  'vendor_id' VARCHAR(45) NULL,\n  'pet_size' VARCHAR(45) NULL,\n  'pet_type' VARCHAR(45) NULL,\n  'rating' INT NULL, \n  're_buy' TINYINT(1) NULL,\n  PRIMARY KEY ('product_id'));`\n\nAccording to data dictionary provided, I then wrote queries for each column to validate the values. For any columns that were not valid or required some cleaning, I also wrote some script to filter and transform where necessary. \n\n## Data Cleaning & Transformation\n\n`select product_id, count(*) from test.pet_store\ngroup by product_id having count(*) > 1`<br>\nZero rows returned, which means there are no duplicate values.\n\n`select distinct product_category from test.pet_store`<br>\nThis query returned 11 values, as expected, as described. \n(Namely 'Medicine', 'Supplements', 'Grooming', 'Accessory', 'Food', 'Snack', 'Equipment', 'Clothes', 'Bedding', 'Housing', 'Toys')\n\n`select replace(trim('$' from sales), ',', '') from test.pet_store`<br>\nThis query transforms the Sales column values per the data description. the TRIM() function removes the dollar sign at the start. \nThat function is nested witin the REPLACE() function which replaces the comma with an empty string.There was no need to cast as an integer type becase that was done automatically.\n\n`select * from test.pet_store \nwhere pet_size not in ('extra_small', 'small', 'medium', 'large', 'extra_large')`<br>\nall expected and valid values\n\n`select * from test.pet_store\nwhere pet_type not in ('cat' ,'dog', 'fish', 'bird')`<br>\nAccording to the data description, all other pet_types besides the one mentioned are to be excluded from the analysis. This query returns those that are not part of the list.\nIt returned 46 rows, where the pet_type values were either 'rabbit' or 'hamster'\nThese will be filtered out in the final dataset\n\n`select * from test.pet_store where rating not between 1 and 10` <br> \nzero rows returned. so all rating values are between expected range\n\n`select * from test.pet_store\nwhere re_buy not in (0, 1)`<br>\nall rating values are between expected range\n\n\nOnce I had validated and performed all necessary tranformations and filters, I compiled them all into one script. I exported the results to use for data analysis and visualisation. The clean dataset had 833 values.\n\n`SELECT \nproduct_id,\nproduct_category, \nreplace(trim('$' from sales), ',', '') as sales, \nprice, \nvendor_id,\npet_size, \npet_type, \nrating, \nre_buy\nFROM test.pet_store \nWHERE pet_type in ('cat' ,'dog', 'fish', 'bird')`<br>","metadata":{},"id":"c8610b01-c3a8-40e2-9002-2e03e1db1879","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Data Discovery and Visualization\nDescribe what you found in the analysis and how the visualizations answer the customer questions in the project brief.

This is 46.8%.\nThis could indicate that PetMind have not got the best brand loyalty and that they should make it their focus.\n\n![Number of ReBuys Per Product Category](Number_of_Products_Rebought_Per_Category.jpg)\n\nWe can evaluate how the number of rebought values varies per product category. \nWe can see in the graph above, there is vary litttle variation amongst product categories, with most categories having most products bought once.\n\nLooking at the the categories with the highes sales - Toys, Snacks & Equpiment - we can see that only 1 of them have more rebought products\nThis can indicate that \n- a) rebought products don't seem to be postively correlated with sales and \n- b) there is no strong correlation between product categories and rebuys.\n\n### Do the products being purchased again have better sales than others?\n\n![Sum and Average of Sales of Rebuys](Total_vs_average_sales_of_rebuys_v2.jpg)\n\nIt's clear from the graph on the left, that the the majority of total sales come from products only bought once. However, average volume of sales is slightly higher for rebought items (shown on the bar chart on the left).This indicates that while less products are rebought, the ones that are, generate more sales overall.\n\nSo selling more of those rebought items, (ie through the box subsciption), would generate more sales compared to single bought products. This supports the strategy to launch a monthly pet box subscription.\n\n### What products are more likely to be purchased again for different types of pets?\n\n![Highest_Rebought_Product_Categories_per_Pet_Type](Highest_Rebought_Product_Categories_per_Pet_Type.jpg)\n\nThe above chart shows the sum of Rebuys per category per pet type. It shows that Equipment, Snack & Toys, are rebought the most for every pet (Besides dogs, where the most rebought product categories are Equipment, Toys and Medicine).\n\nThis chart can be used to determine what product categories should be included in each pet box subscription.\n\nThe limitation of this visual is that it doesnt show the sum in relative to the entire population. \n\n![Pet Type vs Product Category Heatmap](Pet_Type_vs_Product_Category_Heatmap.jpg)\n\nThe heatmap above, visualises the highest number of rebought products per product category and pet type, relative to the whole population. I selected this graph because it can show the number of rebuys between both discreet variables in respect to the entire dataset, and therefore offer new insight from another perspective.\n\nWhile in the previous graph, it was shown that for each pet_type, Equpiment and Toys were rebought the most, this graph shows that Birds and Fish contribute very little. The number of total rebuys, irrespective of product category, are very low for Fish and Birds.\n\nThis indicates, that PetMind should not offer a pet box subscription for these two pets.\n\nInstead they should only offer pet box subscriptions for Cats and Dogs, as these two pet types have the highest number of rebuy products.\n\nFor the Cat Box, they should offer Equipment and Toys products.\nFor the dogs box, they should offer equipment and snack products.\nThese are the two most rebought product categories for the two most pets with highest rebuys.\n\n![Top 3 Product IDs for each Pet Box](Top_3_Product_IDs_for_each_Pet_Box.jpg)\nBuilding on top of the conclusion from the last graph, this bar chart shows the three product_ids with the highest sales per pet box subscription.\n\n- For the Cat Pet Box, the highest selling products are 4803, 4865 and 4859\n- For the Dog Pet Box, the highest selling products are 4430, 4836 and 4232.\n\nThis are products that should be included in each pet box, as they generate the most sales and are more likely to be rebought.","metadata":{},"id":"8d968a2f-a614-4896-bb09-0a9fd3487d5e","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"### Conclusion\n\nPetMind should go forward with the monthly pet box subscriptions but only offer them for cat and dog owners.\n- For the Cat Pet Box, they could include products 4803, 4865 and 4859.\n- For the Dog Pet Box, they could include products 4430, 4836 and 4232.\n\n### Further Analysis\n\nFurther analysis could be done to find out exactly how many times a product is bought. \nThe extra granularity would enable us to also analyse and identify which items are bought the most, and not just generate the most sales.\n\nFurther analysis could also be done to identity whether the pet size has anything to do with sales or is correlated with the number of rebought items.\n(ie. Do bigger pets lead to more rebuys?) \n\nAs PetMind are trying to assess and improve brand loyalty, one metric they might want to explore further is the ratings and see if there is any correlation with sales or rebuys. Also its hard to assess customer retention without data on the customers. PetMind should also consider analysinf their customers, as well as their product. They could gain insights on which customers are more likely to buy again, the cost to retain each customer and each customer lifetime value (CLV).","metadata":{},"id":"86370730-9f85-4728-8c3d-894a968f5159","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## ✅ When you have finished...\n-  Publish your Workspace using the option on the left\n-  Check the published version of your report:\n\t-  Can you see everything you want us to grade?\n    -  Are all the graphics visible?\n-  Review the grading rubric.
