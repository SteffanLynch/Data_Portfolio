for i in range(10):
    print("i is now {}".format(i))

#or

i = 0
while i < 10
    print("i is now {}".format(i))
    i += 1
    #i = i + 1

    #if "i += 1" wasnt indented into the while block, the loop would print
    # "i is now 0" because it has not mechanism of incrementing the number
    # anc would always remain true.


#of the most important features of while loops is that they can be used
# when you dont know how many times you will need to loop. A for loop will
# repeat for each item in a predetermined sequence whereas a while loop
# you dont need to know how many timed the loop will execute.
